# **WWImporters SQL Querying Project**  
This repository contains SQL queries developed using the Wide World Importers (WWI) database from Microsoft found at [Microsoft's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0). The queries explore various possible business insights and SQL functionalities, making this project a valuable resource for further enrinching SQL knowledge in a Business Intelligence context

## **Project Overview**  
The **Wide World Importers** dataset is a **sample database provided by Microsoft**, designed to mimic real-world transactional and analytical workloads. This project leverages **SQL Server** to execute various queries that extract possible meaningful insights from the dataset.

### **Key Objectives**  
- Write **SQL queries** to analyze business performance and answer business questions across various contexts (dimensions).  
- Explore the use of **Specific Datetime functions, Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Aggregations and Window Functions**.  
- Deliver well-structured, formatted data that can be leveraged by other departments for dashboard development and decision-making.

## **Notes**
Although the scripts used to create part of the schema are provided in this repository, in order to replicate the work done I recommend downloading the OLAP .bak file, from the referenced source, and recovering the database onto SQL Server. The schema provided here is solely for reference and to consider in order to understand the queries that were developed.
